### What's up, dude! üññ

I'm David Teixeira from Brazil (üáßüá∑) and I decided to head into in this Development's World, after all, code creation is the POWER‚ú®! I'm studying some projects proposed by RocketSeat and Alura, and some their already available are in my [repositories](https://github.com/DavidTeixeira92?tab=repositories).

Nowadays, I'm a informatic professional, especifically, in the support's area, but too I'm a teacher in the platform online, Youtube, [TD Educa√ß√£o channel](https://juntossomosmais.com.br). It's my hobby.

In my free time I like to play mobile games, to watch Netflix and YouTube and to learn something new.

Finally, I leave the following message:

CODE IS LOVE! ‚ù§Ô∏è

CODE IS LIFE! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Would you like to find me?
